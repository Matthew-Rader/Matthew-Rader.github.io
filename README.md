## Project Goal
Update my SquareSpace portfolio to a handbuilt website that aims to consolidate my experiences into a smaller and more easily digestible package; effectively, make it easier and faster to see who I am and what I do.

## Purpose
To practice my web development and site design abilities while simultaneously iterating on my professional appearance through my portfolio.

## Playbook
1. Consolidate my current portfolio into smaller "scenes" that express who I am and my interests
    ex. A scene for all my WSoft games, a scene for who I am as a software engineer (Inora, Thomson Reuters), a scene for music ...
2. Archive my SquareSpace site so that blog post and postmortem content is still accessible

## Usage

```
git clone <this-repo>
npm install
npm run dev
```
